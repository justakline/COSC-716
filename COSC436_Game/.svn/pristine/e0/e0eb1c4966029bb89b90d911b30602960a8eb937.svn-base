## Overview:

This is a text-based adventure game "shell" where new items and rooms can be added and modified as
the course progresses.

* This code ***REQUIRES*** `Java\JDK version 21` or higher to compile and run.\
  If you receive syntax errors when first attempting to run this code, 
  an outdated version of Java is ALMOST always the cause!
* JDK 25 is now available as the current "LTS" (Long-Term Support) version of Java.

* JDKs _above_ `21` may be used, but all code additions should have a Java "source-level" of `21` or lower.
  The "source-level" is configurable from with in nearly any Java IDE.
    * The Java/JDK is available for download from many locations.\
      Personally, I recommend any of the following:
        * [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)
        * [Azul](https://www.azul.com/downloads/#downloads-table-zulu)
        * [GraalVM](https://www.graalvm.org/)

---
* Please note that the code in the `core` package of the game should ***NOT*** be modified!
  Instead, new classes should be added to the `world` package to add new functionality.

* New to adding content? See: `GETTING_STARTEDs.md`

* The SVN repository for this project is located at:  
  `svn://cosc436.net:65436/Game/XXX/trunk` (where 'XXX' is the **section number** of the course).

  For *example*, Section `123` would use: `svn://cosc436.net:65436/Game/123/trunk`


* The repository is organized as follows (replacing `XXX` with your section number):
    * `.../XXX/trunk`     - The main, read-only, development branch
    * `.../XXX/branches`  - A directory containing active 'branches' for each student

### IMPORTANT NOTE:

**Not all design decisions in the 'game shell' adhere to 'best practices' for a complete, real-world
software development project!**

Some 'design compromises' were made to enable the creation of student-generated `Rooms`
and `Items` as a foundation for implementing various design patterns throughout the course.

Consequently, by the end of the semester, there will be a significant amount of logic redundancy
across the rooms and items that would be better consolidated within the game's core. Otherwise,
we'd have 30 students all attempting to make conflicting modifications to the same code!
